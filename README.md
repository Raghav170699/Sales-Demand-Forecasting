# Demand and Sales Forecasting Project for RPI UK 

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting demand and sales for various products of Rotary Precision Instruments UK Ltd. The aim is to assist in effective decision-making and resource allocation by analyzing historical data and employing advanced forecasting techniques.

---

## Objective
To improve the accuracy of demand and sales forecasts using statistical modeling techniques and evaluate performance using key error metrics.

---

## Methodologies Used
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensuring clean and structured input data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Deriving meaningful features for model input.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Understanding seasonal patterns and trends in the data.
4. **Forecasting Models**: 
    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
    - Exponential Smoothing
    - Linear Regression-based models
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessment using error metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE.
